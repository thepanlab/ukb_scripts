# ukb_scripts
Scripts to download, process and merge ukb SNPs data using plink1.9

Run:
$chmod u+rwx *
$./get_data.sh

Make sure the ukb key file (.key) name is updated to your project key file name.

There is also a python script to extract phenotypes from ukb on a jupyer notebook.
It uses Python3.6, pandas, numpy and multiprocessing modules. The ICD(number) codes 
or self-reported codes come from the [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11953-9)
